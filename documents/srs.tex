\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose of This Document}

This system requirements specification details what our course evaluation system does and what tests we will make to ensure the system is complete. It includes why we are creating the system, the scope of the product, diagrams that illustrate the system, what we will deliver to the customer, and currently pending issues about the software.

This document is intended for the development team, the product client, Dr. Harlan Onsrud, and potential users of the system. Team EVAL needs this document to ensure that the product works as intended. Dr. Onsrud needs it to know that he will receive the program that he desires. The document also helps the software's users in that they can learn more about the functions of the evaluation system.

\subsection{Purpose of the Product}

The University of Maine gives out course evaluation surveys to students at the end of each course. The survey is filled on a bubble sheet and is then scanned. Harlan Onsrud finds it inconvenient for the school administrators to manually scan and compile the survey results. He desires an online, automated evaluation system to improve productivity.\par

\subsection{Product Scope}

Team EVAL will create a product which interfaces with an already existing survey software, LimeSurvey, to provide both individual teachers and administrators the ability to create and administer evaluations.  This product will be usable even by those without technical backgrounds, and it will have an intuitive interface for setting up and administering teacher evaluations.

It will allow users to create one or more courses with predefined survey data and rosters of e-mail addresses.   After creating a class, users will be able to choose from provided questions or enter their own custom questions.  The question sets that they make can be saved to their account and applied to future evaluations they create.  Upon request of the user, the product will create a LimeSurvey with the supplied information and send it out to the students on the class' roster via e-mail.  When the survey is completed, the product will allow users to view and download a statistical analysis and clear visualization of the data collected for one or more of their courses.

The product will be completed in time to administer teacher evaluations for the spring of 2019 at the University of Maine. A UML diagram (Figure 1) shows the scope as a dotted rectangle.\par

\subsection{Tests}

These are the tests that will verify the functional requirements:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item (Use Case 1) The tester attempts to log on to the system using four different sets of credentials: a valid e-mail address and password of an existing account (with courses already created), a valid address and password of a nonexistent account, an address with an invalid password for an existing account, and an invalid e-mail address and password. The test is successful if the first set passes and the last three sets fail.
  \item (Use Case 2) The tester selects the option to add a course preset, then submits generic survey data, preferences, and a course roll. The test is successful only if all the data entered is reflected in the database.  The data should still be there after logging out of the system. The team will create several presets to ensure that each is loaded up with the default list of questions, and we will test adding students' e-mails to the list of enrolled students.
  \item (Use Case 3) The tester creates a survey preset with generic data. He or she then tries to select that same preset to be used again. The new preset should still be present on LimeSurvey. The test is successful only if the preset data is loaded correctly to LimeSurvey from the database. The tester will exit the evaluation system and log in again to ensure that the data is saved.
  \item (Use Case 4) The tester selects the option to create a survey. Next, he or she chooses a questions preset for the survey. The tester then adds one question and edits an existing question from the preset. After submitting, the database should include the new survey, containing the preset list, added question, and edited question. The team will run the program several times, each time selecting different questions to be included in the survey. We will ensure that some questions are mandatory and must be included no matter what.
  \item (Use Case 5) The tester creates a course survey, does not enter any questions, and attempts to send the survey.  The tester then enters some questions and sends the survey again.  The team verifies that the survey is created with all questions entered and that the e-mail addresses on the course roster receive a prompt to complete it. 
  \item (Use Case 6) The tester messages a group of ten unique people about a mock survey. In a successful test, all ten people receive an e-mail with each containing a link to the survey. Most respondents promptly complete the survey, but one does not. The database must contain the survey responses of the nine people who finished, and the program must send another reminder e-mail to the unfinished person about the survey. Finally, the database must delete old survey data. The team will set the time periods before the reminder e-mail and data deletion to be very short to test whether the two functions work.
  \item (Use Case 7) The tester selects the option to view the survey results. There are survey results for a mock instructor, mock department, and mock university. The team will add several surveys, each with different questions. If the test is successful, the correct average scores for every question in the course evaluation survey are shown in the application. Also, the software must show the average for the mock instructor, department, and university.

\subsection{Tests}

These are the tests that will verify the non-functional requirements:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The tester attempts to run the program on the last versions of Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android. The test is successful only if all five use cases execute properly on each operating system.
  \item The tester attempts to run the program on the last versions of Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. The test is successful only if all five use cases execute properly on each browser.
  \item The tester inputs five diverse questions into a mock survey and sends the survey to a mock student. The test is successful only if the mock student can follow the link to a survey showing those five questions.
  \item The tester inputs a course, questions preset, and survey. The test is successful only if all data for the course, preset, and survey are present in the database, and if that data correctly follows the database schema.
  \item The tester inputs the same course, preset, and survey as in test 4. The test is successful only if any function in the software does not change the survey responses stored in the database.
  \item The tester creates three users for the evaluation program. Each user inputs a different course, questions preset, and survey. The test is successful if the users cannot view nor modify each other's data.
  \item The tester runs an automatic script that simulates several hours of using the software. The test is successful only if the average time between two errors in the software is at least 60 simulated minutes.
  \item The tester inputs a course, present, and survey as a teacher, then poses as someone unauthorized to use the software. In a successful test, the tester cannot view nor modify any data present in the database.
  \item Five testers complete a survey sent by the software, and a sixth tester uses the software afterwards. The test is successful only if the sixth tester cannot find the identities of anyone who gave a response meant to be anonymous.
  \item The tester runs an automatic script that sets up the software with three colleges, 1000 courses per college, 1000 teachers per university, and 500 students per course. The test is successful if all five use cases execute properly for all courses.
  \item The tester sees the info for the folder containing the code. The folder size is at most 500 megabytes if the test passes.
  \item Ten computer users attempt to access the source code on GitHub. The test is successful if all users can do so.
  \item The tester reads the GNU General Public License and University of Maine AFUM requirements. The test is successful if the software meets all terms in both the license and AFUM requirements.

\section{Open Issues}

The most significant issue our team has relates to the non-anonymous student responses. In a course evaluation survey, a student has the option to add a signed comment to be stored in an instructor's file. However, the LimeSurvey software does not store the identities of survey respondents. We need to find a way to collect the signed comment along with the survey, while ensuring that the signature is authentic.

There are several more minor issues that need to be resolved. We have not decided what information about each course should be stored in the database. We do not know what format to use for storing the survey data. We should also know which question presets and which surveys' results are visible to each user. Another issue is how often to notify students about their survey. Finally, we need to know whether to require a Google account for a student who wants to submit a non-anonymous response.

The team projects that all of the above issues will be resolved by the end of November.

\section{Agreement Between Customer and Contractor}
This page shows that all members of Team EVAL and the client, Harlan Onsrud, have agreed on all the information in the system requirements specification. By signing this document, Team EVAL and Dr. Onsrud agree on the goals and scope of the project, each use case and requirement, the tests for each requirement, and how the deliverables will be sent.

The team will follow a process in the case that the requirements specification is changed after we sign it. First, the team writes a rough draft of the changes to be made to the document. Second, all team members and Harlan Onsrud will sign the document agreeing to the changes. Finally, the changes are made to the final copy of the specification.
